The objective of this exercise is to pratice Javascript Loop.

Project Description:
- I was given a list of names. The task is to filter out 2 names and put them in the "refused" list. And add the rest of the list to "admitted" list using a loop function.
- In my exercise, I chose to use "for loop" and "if else statements" combination to to achieve the desired outcome. I also use some techniques that I have learned from modzilla, W3School and The Odin Projects such as list and others.
